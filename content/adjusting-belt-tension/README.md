# How to adjust belt tension on the Qidi Plus 4

(Better description to come)

This is essentially a mix of the Qidi Max 3, and the Qidi Q1 Pro belt adjustment procedures.

- First, turn the printer off.
- Then we loosen the 8 belt tension clamping bolts on the rear of the Plus 4.  See the photos below.  About 3 full turns anti-clockwise on each bolt is sufficient to release their clamping pressure.
- Move the print-head around for about 5 "laps" of the [Q1 Pro procedure](https://wiki.qidi3d.com/en/Q1-Pro/Maintenance/Adjustment-belt#h-3referring-to-the-figure-below-move-the-print-head-and-stop-it-at-the-front-left-corner)
- Now re-tighten the belt tension clamping bolts on the rear of the printer again
