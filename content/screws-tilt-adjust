The Screws_Tilt_Adjust macro in printer.cfg is commented out on stock without the needed screw locations added. 
Adding in the locations from [BED_SCREWS] directly will not work as this places the nozzle over the desired area and not the inductive probe which could result in a nozzle crash

The x and y stock nozzle offset for the inductive probe is:
x_offset: 25
y_offset: 1.3

Using the screw locations from [Bed_Screws] and probe offset we can get the required coordinates so that we can utilize the inductive probe for SCREWS_TILT_CALIBRATE

In printer.cfg, replace
#[screws_tilt_adjust]
#screw_thread: CM-M4

with:

[screws_tilt_adjust]
screw1:0,19.7
screw1_name: Front left
screw2: 260,19.7
screw2_name: Front right
screw3: 260,279.7
screw3_name: Last right
screw4: 0,279.7
horizontal_move_z: 10.
speed: 50.
screw_thread: CW-M4

Home your printer then run Z_TILT_ADJUST
Once finished type SCREWS_TILT_CALIBRATE into your console and follow the directions on adjusting each screw either clock-wise or counter clockwise. The direction is based from looking at the screws from above.
