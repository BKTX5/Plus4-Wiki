# 0.2mm Layer Height High Quality Profile

## Best Quality Recommendation

**It is STRONGLY recommend to set the minimum layer time to no less than 10s in the filament settings (See box highlighted in Yellow in the image below)**

Doing this will ensure there is sufficient time for the filament to bond properly to the preceding layer, as well as solidify sufficiently before the next layer is added.

For smaller models this will also ensure a more even layer time, which minimises visible ridge on the walls around transitions from solid to sparse infill areas.
